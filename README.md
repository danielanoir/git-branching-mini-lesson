Terms: Branches, Deploying, Pushing
## Lesson Objectives
By the end of the lesson students will be to:

- Publish a webpage to GitHub pages
- Know when to deploy

## Framing (5 min)

### Steps for Deployment Process

<!-- These will be conceptual, not mechanical -->

2. Clone down this repo and add content
3. Create a new branch for deployment
4. Push this branch to GitHub account
5. Navigate to page and see the results

 <!-- CFU -->

<!--Expectation: By the end of the framing, all they should know are the steps involved in the deployment process -->

<!-- The LO of actually deploying will occur during the Individual Practice -->

<!-- Do Sampling Cold Calls: Have students close laptops and recall steps of the deployment process after having given them 30 seconds to memorize, more assessment than test, keep it informal -->

## I Do (10 min)

<!-- I do the mechanical steps, while frame what I am conceptually -->

<!-- Consider having students keeping their laptops closed just be a bonus  -->

<!-- Sampling Cold Calls Again: What's my first step here? Don't correct until everyone answers -->


## We Do (10 min)

<!-- I do the conceptual, student tell me mechanically what I should be doing -->

<!-- Have students recall where to go  etc -->
<!-- Identify steps -->


<!-- Assuming 6 steps, do 1, 2, 3 steps -->
